This directory contains a static copy of all the ravel files.  This was written to work within the SPOT project.  It may take some work for this to fully function as a standalone.

Notable upgrades from the last Ravel include:
The ability to switch between the two graph types
Turning message lines on and off
Multi-Instance support
Open and close within Spot
Legend
